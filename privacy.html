  <h1>Privacy Policy (GDPR-Compliant Version)</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 18.02.2025</p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Welcome to our application (“App”), which is developed for academic and research purposes. 
    This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, disclose, and protect your personal data in 
    compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other applicable data protection laws. 
    By accessing or using the App, you consent to the practices described in this Privacy Policy.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Data Controller</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Name/Institution:</strong> Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg</li>
    <li><strong>Address:</strong> Not applicable</li>
    <li><strong>Contact Email:</strong> jonathan.richter@outlook.de</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Under the GDPR, the above entity is the “Data Controller,” responsible for determining the purposes 
    and means of processing personal data.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Lawful Basis for Processing</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Legitimate Interests (Art. 6(1)(f)):</strong> 
      We process publicly available data from TikTok to pursue our legitimate interest in conducting 
      academic research on political content by German politicians.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Academic/Research Purposes:</strong> 
      In some jurisdictions, academic research is considered a task carried out in the public interest 
      (Art. 6(1)(e)) or recognized as a compatible purpose under Recital 50 GDPR. Where applicable, we ensure 
      that processing is proportionate, respects data minimization, and does not unduly impact the rights 
      and freedoms of individuals.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>4. Data Collection</h2>
  <p><strong>4.1 Public TikTok Data</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      We collect publicly available information from TikTok, such as video metadata (titles, captions, hashtags), 
      user names of public figures (e.g., verified politicians), and engagement metrics (likes, comments, shares).
    </li>
    <li>
      We do not intentionally collect sensitive personal data (e.g., political opinions, health data) 
      unless it is part of the publicly available content from official political accounts.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>4.2 User-Generated Content</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      If the TikTok content includes comments from other users, these comments are also publicly visible on TikTok. 
      We only process these comments in an aggregated or anonymized form for research analysis, wherever feasible.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>4.3 Technical Information</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      When you interact with our App or website, our servers may automatically collect certain information 
      (e.g., IP address, browser type, operating system, timestamps).
    </li>
    <li>
      This data is used for security, debugging, and performance optimization.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>4.4 Voluntary Communications</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      If you contact us (e.g., via email), we may collect the information you provide (e.g., name, email address) 
      to respond to your inquiry.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5. Purpose of Processing</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Academic Research:</strong> 
      We analyze collected data to study how German politicians use TikTok, including patterns in political 
      communication and public engagement. The results of our analysis may be published in academic papers, 
      reports, or presentations, without including personal data that can identify private individuals.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>App Improvement:</strong> 
      We use aggregated usage data and error logs to improve the App’s performance, stability, and user experience.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Compliance with Legal Obligations:</strong> 
      We may process or disclose data if required by applicable law or in response to valid legal requests.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
  <p>
    We only retain data as long as necessary to fulfill the research purposes for which it was collected. 
    When data is no longer needed, we will either delete it securely or anonymize it so that it can no longer 
    be linked to any individual.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
  <p><strong>7.1 Third-Party Services</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      We may use hosting providers or analytics tools (e.g., GitHub Pages) to operate the App. These services 
      may process certain technical data on our behalf. We ensure these third parties adhere to GDPR requirements 
      and only process data based on our instructions.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>7.2 Academic Publications</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Findings derived from our research may be published, but will not include personally identifiable 
      information of private individuals. Public figures (e.g., verified politicians) may be identified if 
      their TikTok accounts are inherently public.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>7.3 Legal Requirements</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      We may disclose data if legally obliged to do so or to protect our rights (e.g., in case of legal disputes).
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>8. International Data Transfers</h2>
  <p>
    If our servers or third-party services are located outside the European Economic Area (EEA), we will ensure 
    an adequate level of protection by using EU Standard Contractual Clauses or relying on an adequacy decision, 
    in accordance with Articles 44–49 GDPR.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Your Rights under the GDPR</h2>
  <p>
    Under the GDPR, you have the following rights regarding your personal data:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Right of Access (Art. 15)</strong>: Request confirmation of whether we process your personal data and obtain a copy of it.</li>
    <li><strong>Right to Rectification (Art. 16)</strong>: Request correction of inaccurate personal data.</li>
    <li><strong>Right to Erasure (Art. 17)</strong>: Request deletion of your personal data under certain circumstances.</li>
    <li><strong>Right to Restrict Processing (Art. 18)</strong>: Request restriction of processing if you contest the accuracy or lawfulness of the data.</li>
    <li><strong>Right to Data Portability (Art. 20)</strong>: Receive your personal data in a structured, commonly used format and have it transferred to another controller.</li>
    <li><strong>Right to Object (Art. 21)</strong>: Object to processing based on our legitimate interests at any time.</li>
    <li><strong>Right not to be Subject to Automated Decision-Making (Art. 22)</strong>: We do not engage in automated decision-making with legal or similarly significant effects.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>

  </p>

  <h2>10. Security Measures</h2>
  <p>
    We implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect your data from unauthorized access, 
    alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However, no security measure is completely foolproof, and we cannot 
    guarantee absolute security.
  </p>

  <h2>11. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    Our App is not intended for individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information 
    from children. If you believe we have inadvertently collected such data, please contact us so we can promptly 
    delete it.
  </p>

  <h2>12. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements. 
    Any updates will be posted on this page with an updated “Last updated” date.
